# APIS-SAB
This project was developed for a Node.js and Express.js assessment. It demonstrates key concepts such as routing, middleware, EJS view rendering, and RESTful API design. The scope was intentionally kept manageable — using mock data, minimal styling, and a clear structure — to fit within the timeline while showcasing practical implementation of core backend features. The theme (National Park Visitor App) was chosen to make the project engaging, while still fulfilling all technical expectations.
